# ruby_parser_task
A short challenge set as a tech test

## Plan

The below diagram shows my plan for the two classes and their responsibilities that will be required to complete the task.

There are a lot of different ways to complete the challenge. My approach is to stick to object orientated principles and to try and make the code a clear as possible, easy to change and to follow a TDD approach. One option I considered was to just make one class which reads the file, formats the data and then prints it. However, I think using two classes separates the responsibilities of reading the file and formatting the output information which makes the code easier to understand and easier to add additional features in afterwards.
